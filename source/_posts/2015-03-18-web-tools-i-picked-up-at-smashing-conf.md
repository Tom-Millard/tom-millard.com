Probably worth getting these written up and put on the internet before I loose my notes, so in no order - a quick list of tools I picked up at smashing conference Oxford.

-   <https://www.fullstory.com> - simply put this allows you to collect data about how users interact with your site. Prices start at about $150 per-month
-   <http://www.webpagetest.org/> - for running a page speed test, looks more in depth than [pingdom](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/) and [google page insight tool](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/)
-   <https://luckymarmot.com/paw> - for mac lovers looking to go head first into some REST API analysis. Starting at $29.99 in the app store
-   <https://www.getpostman.com/> - again for helping with API debugging (need to look into this)
-   <https://ngrok.com/> - a simple command line tool for allowing outside access to your local-environment
-   <http://www.charlesproxy.com/> - I have no idea but it sound, just the best thing.
-   <http://nwjs.io/> - Build desktop application in node.js, why not?
-   <https://popapp.in/> - Useful for pen and paper wire-framing
-   <http://keynotopia.com/> - Convert powerpoint and keynote in to an exceptional wire-framing tool
-   <https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/> - Used as an example during a talk on service workers. Used to manipulate and optimise SVG's

And we are done.
